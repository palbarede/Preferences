# If set to ‘on’, Readline performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive
# fashion. The default value is ‘off’.

# If set to ‘on’, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, Readline treats hyphens (‘-’) and
# underscores (‘_’) as equivalent when performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.

# If set to ‘on’, when listing completions, Readline displays the
# common prefix of the set of possible completions using a different
# color. The color definitions are taken from the value of the
# LS_COLORS environment variable. The default is ‘off’.

# When set to ‘On’, Readline will configure the terminal in a way that will enable it to insert each
# paste into the editing buffer as a single string of characters, instead of treating each character
# as if it had been read from the keyboard. This can prevent pasted characters from being
# interpreted as editing commands. The default is ‘off’.
